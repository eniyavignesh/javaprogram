/*
 The java.util.concurrent package defines a set of interfaces whose implementations execute tasks. The simplest one of
these is the Executor interface:

public interface Executor {
void execute(Runnable command);
}
Hence an Executor implementation takes the given Runnable instance and executes it. The interface makes no assumptions
about the way of the execution, the javadoc only states "Executes the given command at some time in the future.".
